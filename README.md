# smart-cleaner-sim
A small robot simulation project exploring intelligent cleaning behavior using Python.

# Smart Cleaning Robot Simulation 🧹🤖

A mini simulation project exploring intelligent cleaning algorithms for robotic systems.  
Developed using Python to test obstacle avoidance, room coverage efficiency, and AI decision-making.

## 🧠 Project Idea
Inspired by the concept of autonomous vacuum robots, this project simulates a simple agent navigating a 2D room using sensors and logic-based pathfinding.  
The goal is to achieve **maximum coverage with minimum redundancy**.

## 🧩 Technologies
- Python
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Numpy (for simulation grid)
- Logic-based movement control

## 🚀 Next Step
Integrate basic reinforcement learning to improve decision-making efficiency.
